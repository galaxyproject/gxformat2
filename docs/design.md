# gxformat2 Design Considerations

## Goals

1) gxformat2 should be human readable and writable
1) gxformat2 should be able to be consumed by Galaxy without access to a Galaxy toolbox
1) gxformat2 should be convertible to Galaxy's original workflow format without a Galaxy runtime
1) gxformat2 should align with workflows standards (and specifically the Common Workflow Langauge) when it is pratical
1) We will work on solidifying a version of gxformat2 called 19.09 that is compatible with the workflow models in
   Galaxy versions 19.09-24.1 and which can be fixed for older versions with just a gxformat2 dependency upgrade.
   At some point in the future there will be a new a version for implementation ideas
   the require changes to the Galaxy model.

## Specific

John will fill out comments on specific issues here once the goals are merged on. Comments will come in as PRs with pings.
